ShaneKBot Version 0.0.1

ShaneKBot is an IRC bot that was created for a competition on DreamInCode, but more as a reason to use my generic client class.

ShaneKBot currently:
*Joins IRC servers and channels
*Plays tic-tac-toe.
**Either in PM or public channel, with or without delay - to prevent flooding in public, but allow it in pm
*Greets people that greet it
*Quits on owner (my) command
